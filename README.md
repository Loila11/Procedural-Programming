# Procedural-Programming
Projects based on procedural programming principles

1. Encryption:
 The program is encryping and then decrypting an image with a given path.

2. Template-Matching:
 The program is searching for certain templates in a given image and drawing a frame around them. By default it is set to find the digits from 0 to 9 on a board with hand-written numbers and draw a differently coloured frame for each.
